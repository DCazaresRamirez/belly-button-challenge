# belly-button-challenge

Project Overview
This project is an interactive dashboard built using HTML, JavaScript, D3.js, and Plotly.js to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs microbes found in human navels and reveals insights into their distribution across various individuals.

The dashboard allows users to explore the top 10 microbial species (OTUs) present in selected individuals, view demographic information, and visualize data in a bubble chart and a horizontal bar chart.

Features
Dropdown Menu for Test Subjects:
-Allows users to select a test subject ID from the dataset.
Demographic Information Panel:
-Displays metadata such as age, location, and other demographic info for the selected individual.
Top 10 OTUs Bar Chart:
-Visualizes the top 10 microbial species found in the selected individual's navel.
Bubble Chart:
-Displays the quantity of all detected microbial species for the selected individual with each bubble's size representing the sample value.
