# belly-button-challenge

<h2>Project Overview</h2> <br>
This project is an interactive dashboard built using HTML, JavaScript, D3.js, and Plotly.js to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset catalogs microbes found in human navels and reveals insights into their distribution across various individuals. <br><br>

The dashboard allows users to explore the top 10 microbial species (OTUs) present in selected individuals, view demographic information, and visualize data in a bubble chart and a horizontal bar chart.
